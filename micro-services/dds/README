Building DDS Suite in PC environment:
-------------------------------------



Build DDS service images:
-------------------------
Build RustDDS Publisher service (Domain ID 2) image using Dockerfile_RustDDS_Pub_D2.
Build RustDDS Subscriber service (Domain ID 1) image using Dockerfile_RustDDS_Sub_D1.

Build DDSRouter image:
----------------------
Build the docker image under a DDS router colcon build environment. Place the docker file in the same level as ddsrouter.repos
Get the docker file from ddsrouter src repo.


Test setup for DDS router using docker:
---------------------------------------

1. Run rust dds shapes demo subscriber with domain id=1

docker run --network="host" -ti --rm dds-shape-demo-sub-1:1.0.0

2. Run rust dds shapes demo publisher with domain id=2
docker run --network="host" -ti --rm dds-shape-demo-pub-2:1.0.0

3. Run RTI shapes demo with domain id=0 and publish a square with default settings

./rtishapesdemo

4. Run dds router with shapes demo configuration which routes messages between domain 0 and domain 1

docker run --network="host" -ti --rm ddsrouter:1.0.6

You can see that the subscriber started in step 1 is not printing the received square messages.
Also observe that no messages from domain 2 is passing to domain 0.
